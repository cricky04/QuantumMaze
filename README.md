# QuantumMaze

# Abstract
From the classical maze generation algorithm, Eller, we propose a Qiskit-based Eller implementation. Furthermore, by making the walls in an entangled state, we expect QuMa to be a starting point to understanding the essential of quantum computing - entanglement.

# Description 
QuMa is a 8-bit style puzzle game where the only goal is exiting the maze. However, the walls are entangled, which means tracing back your steps will not get you back where you were (unlike physical mazes). 

# Deliverable
A Python based GUI game
